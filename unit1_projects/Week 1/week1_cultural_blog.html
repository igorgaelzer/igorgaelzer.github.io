			<h2>First impressions on Dev Bootcamp`s culture</h2>
			<spam class="phase-week">Phase 0, week 1 - May 18th, 2014</spam>
			<p>
				The way Dev Bootcamp focuses in developing and continually improving it`s culture - who we are / how would we like to be / how to get there - is sexiest aspect of the school in my opinion and main motivator for me to give my best.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dev Bootcamp`s culture quickly engadged me and made me approach this experience not only as a programming course, but also as an opportunity to develope mental tools that will help me in every other aspect of my life. I trully believe in the power of a solid culture based on continuous self-improvement to get people together and make great things happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this first week of preparation my expectations about Dev Bootcamp have just gotten more and more excting. All the things I was hoping to get out this experience have been met and I am finding that it can be much richer that I could have ever pictured when I first applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dev Bootcamp's modern approach to learning - you co-create the learning experience and not just consume it like a product with promisses in a box - is something I really believe in because it takes in consideration the fact that getting great at something demmands an energy that comes from the inside, and there no and external factor you could buy that will do that for you. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe this will be a very engaging experience and, even though all this is very new and at times it does make me get butterflies in my stomach, I am positive this is the best environment for a true and complete learning experience.

			<h2>Design and UX analysis</h2>
			<spam class="phase-week">Phase 0 - Week 1</spam>
			<p>
				I'm very excited to be starting this blog about my experience in Dev Bootcamp. This is the first week of phase 0, and after a long preparation we are starting to build our own websites. Exciting!
			</p>
			<p>
				As our first assignment, we are analyzing the design and user experience of 3 of our favorite sites, cosidering things as how pleasant they are to the eyes, how easy it is to find what you are looking for and etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				My 3 site picks are <strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>Tuts+</strong> and <strong>Mailchimp</strong>.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Medium</h3>

				Medium is my very favorite site. What I really like about it is how it`s designer was able to focus on the most important thing on, the content, and take away mostly all the other things we are used to see on other sites around the web.

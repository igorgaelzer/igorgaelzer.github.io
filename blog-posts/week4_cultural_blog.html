				<h2>Complexity: A problem facing technology</h2>
				<spam class="date">Phase 0, week 4 - June 8th, 2014</spam>
				<p>
					The tech industry is evolving faster and faster. Technology costs are dropping rapidly, it is getting more affordable everyday and more people are getting opportunities to work with it to improve their lifes and the technology itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nowadays, many new technologies come to solve problems of privious technologies, and while most do make our lifes simpler, it's getting harder and harder to keep up with all the changes. People that work with technology are everyday more dependent on other people to do their work as nobody is capable of knowing everything.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, multi-disciplined groups of people are becomming fundamental for making things happen. And for that, people will need to get better and better at working in gropus while being efficient as a whole. For that to work, communication is a absolute necessary skill, and unfortunately too many projects and teams are descontinued because problems derived from bad communication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though many people have a sense that you don't need strong people skills to work with technology, that belief is totally wrong. Technology is nothing more than a reflection of what we are, and even in technology nobody works alone. Tech people are not solving computer problems, they are solving problems for real people.

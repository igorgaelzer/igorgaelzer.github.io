				<h2>Understanding my thinking style</h2>
				<p>
					According to <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this site</a> my thinking style is a mixture of Abstract random and conrete random.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, both my stronger ways to think are random, which means in my mind I can organize information in chucks, without them being in a particular order. This caracteristic allows people to get to desired results without feeling like they need to go through a step-bystep process and, actually, it makes them prefer life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reading <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">this site</a>, I could totally relate my thinking style to the way a learn best. As mainly a Abstract random thinker, I like to absorb information from others, bring harmony to group situations, estabilish healthy relationships with others and focuse in the issues at hand instead of going too far into solving future problems, before you could even understand what the problem is, delaying the relevant things that should be getting done now. Also, I like experimenting to find answers, take risks, follow intuition and solve problems independently.
				</p>
				<p>
					I learn best in a personalized environment, working with broad or general guidlines that will allow me the freedom to work on the problem in the way that makes more sense to me and how it could impact the reality around me. I also like to learn by trial and error and a friendly learning envronment is very important.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the other hand, restrictions and limitations, formal reports, repetitive routines or any kind of not well explained bourocracy that stays in the middle of me and my goal is extremely annoying to me. I like to make things come true, and as I see it, many times we try to protect ourself too much by predicting problems too early - and I'm not saying being prepared for the unexpected is bad, I think it's fundamental - but going too far into future problems can freeze you up now, in the moment, and might actually keep you from even taking the first step. Working with unfriendly people in restrictive environments is also a big no go for me.
				</p>
				
				<h2>My experience during Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp</h2>
				<p>
					I could definitely relate the paragraphs above to my experieces during phase 0. I like learning by doing, testing, picturing somthing exciting in my head and try to make it happen, improve it, and then make it easier and cooler to use, getting to deeper and deeper problems and getting a feel of them - really understanding the root of the problem and what happens if you do it wrong - before researching for the solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					At my learnings during phase 0, I definitely wish I could explore more the knowlegde I`ve been accumulating doing projects, games and trying things out. Most of the time, I feel like I can't do that because time is limited and I have spent most of it reading about problems that do not yet exist to me yet. And that is kind of a bummer because I am so excited to learn by experimenting and being creative with the things I know, then reading about the solutions once I get to the problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been making a big effort to keep myself on track and, even though sometimes I feel like I would learn much faster if I could go deeper into things and just be creative, I have decided to trust the process and move forward. I'm sure it`ll all work out in the end.

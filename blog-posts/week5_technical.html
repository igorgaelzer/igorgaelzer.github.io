				<h2>About Classes in Ruby</h2>
				<spam class="date">Phase 0, week 5 - June 13th, 2014</spam>
				<p>
					Classes - and methods - are basically chunks of code that can be reused later just by calling their name anywhere in the code, which is a great way to avoid repeting code that is ran often in your app. Classes, themselves, are groups of methods that work together to get a certain output from a previous input.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you call a method, you have to pass it the input and, after it runs, you should get the output desired. It could be a number in a different format or a true/false statement confirming that a number or an answer is valid or not, for example.
				</p>
				<p>
					Methods and classes are great because they are like tools you can build on your own. So let's say we are working on a trivia game and, after every answer the user inputs, the app has to check if the answer is true or not and return a praise or a "try again" message to the user. You wouldn't want to reapeat that code again and again after every question in the game, that just wouldn't be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY code</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this situation, you could create a <em>Check_answer</em> method that will do all the work every time the user answers a question.
				</p>

				<h3>Creating a Class</h3>
				<p>
					Creating a Class is super easy. You just have to write <em>class</em> and then give it a name. Of course, you have to close it wih an <em>end</em> tag, then the code that is going to be repeated everytime the class is called is going right between those lines, just as shown below.
				</p>
				<div class="code-sample">
					<p>
						class TheNameYouLike<br>
						<em>... your repeatable code goes here</em><br>
						end
					</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Instance Variables</h4>
				<p>
					As you may know, variables inside methods - or local variables - are not accessible from outside themselves. As a class is basically a group os methods, however, you can define instance variables when you need them to be accessible anywhere inside the class, by any of the methods.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instance variables necessarily need to start with an @ sign.
				</p>

				<div class="code-sample">
					<p>
						class TheNameYouLike(input)<br>
							<span class="p2">def initialize</span><br>
							<span class="p3">@num = input</span> <span class="code-comment"># Makes input from class be available to all methods inside it as @num</span><br>
							<span class="p2">end</span><br>
							<br>
							<span class="p2">def myMethod1</span><br>
							<span class="p3">return @number * 2</span> <span class="code-comment"># Gets @num - or the class input - and returns it multiplied by two</span><br>
							<span class="p2">end</span><br>
						end
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					The <em>input</em> could be anything - an integer, string, array, hash... - and this is how you feed information into your class so it can do the computations and return your desired output.
				</p>

				<h3>Calling a Class</h3>
				<p>
					Considering the class created above, you would define a new variable that is going to point at the class, just as shown below.
				</p>
				
				<div class="code-sample">
					<p>
						doubled_value = TheNameYouLike.new(23) <span class="code-comment"># Creates "doubled_value" variable that is pointing to the TheNameYouLike class</span><br>
						double_value.myMethod1 <span class="code-comment"># Applies myMethod1 to double_value</span><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="code-comment"># returns => 46</span>
					</p>
				</div>
